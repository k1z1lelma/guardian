## Introduction

Today, we use our computers to communicate with people, do our jobs, have fun, and much more. Windows operating systemis one of the most used operating systems in the world. Microsoft leaks a lot of data in the background. These data are not just error messages. It also leaks personal data. It also shares this data with others. It clearly states this on its website. Now let's look at the privacy statement published by Microsoft.

As seen in the agreement, Microsoft admits to collecting personal data. It also tells us that if you refuse to provide this data, we will not be able to use Windows applications and services. One of the purposes for developing the Guardian tool is to protect privacy. Other aim of the project are to take basic security measures on devices with Windows operating system.

## Introduction

Today, we use our computers to communicate with people, do our jobs, have fun, and much more. Windows operating systemis one of the most used operating systems in the world. Microsoft leaks a lot of data in the background. These data are not just error messages. It also leaks personal data. It also shares this data with others. It clearly states this on its website. Now let's look at the privacy statement published by Microsoft.

[Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

As seen in the agreement, Microsoft admits to collecting personal data. It also tells us that if you refuse to provide this data, we will not be able to use Windows applications and services. One of the purposes for developing the Guardian tool is to protect privacy. Other aim of the project are to take basic security measures on devices with Windows operating system.

## Installation

The tool is written in Python programming language. There is no Python 2 support.

* `https://github.com/k1z1lelma/guardian.git`
* `cd guardian`
* `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

## Usage

The program consists of three main menus. Full protection menu with simple security, privacy and adjustment of all settings in these menus.

* When we enter 1 from the keyboard, we enter the simple security menu and the hardening settings we can make in this menu are as in the image.

* I can say that the most important menu is menu number 2. Here, the collection of personal data collected by Microsoft is prevented.

* If you do not want to adjust the settings in the privacy and security menu one by one, the full protection menu is for you :)
